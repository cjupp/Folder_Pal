# Folder_Pal
This program is intended for the mass creation of numbered folders. 
Ideally if one has to organize large amounts of data, pictures, or other media. 
Users can add a prefixing string and suffixing string so that text can be before and/or after the indexing characters.
Subfolders can be added and will be added into every created folder. Sub-subfolders can be created for each subfolder.


Currently, the program has 2 indexing types:
- Numeric: typical base 10 numbering of folders
- Alphabetical: acts as a base 26 numbering system, e.g. 26 = Z, 27 = AA, 28 = AB

Future indexing types:
- Hexadecimal
- Date (Set start date and end date)
- CSV files for creating unique lists

Planned Additions:
- Choose start index and end index

Known Bugs:
- GUI indexing menulist does not display correctly after selecting an item
